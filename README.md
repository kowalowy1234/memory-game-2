# Memory game

### This is a revamped version of my previous personal project.

This time I'm designing and creating this project with multiplayer functionality in mind. Also revamped UI and different tech stack.
The project has two different code bases. The one you are currently looking at is the client side of the project. [Here](https://github.com/kowalowy1234/memory-game-server-2) you can check the other part of it, the server.

Click [here](https://memory-game-181ba.web.app/) to see the previous version.

See the figma design [here](https://www.figma.com/file/Cee8ottwI7oLf9ouuQEyRL/Memory-game?type=design&mode=design&t=8ilPpR1YzsxJEd9X-1). Subject to change.
